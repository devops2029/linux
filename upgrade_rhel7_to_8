Prepare RHEL 7 host for upgrade
Prepare your RHEL 7 host for upgrade by following these steps. In the terminal, run as root:

Disable SELinux for the period of the upgrade.:

setenforce 0
Make sure that you are registered through subscription-manager:

subscription-manager list --installed
Make sure that you have the following repositories enabled:

subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rpms             // Enable the Base repository:
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms      // Enable the Extras repository where Leapp and its dependencies are available
subscription-manager release --unset                               // Set the Red Hat Subscription Manager to use the latest RHEL 7 content
(Optional) Make sure versionlock is cleared if you use yum-plugin-versionlock:

reposync -n -p /localrepo/rhel79 --download-metadata --repo=rhel-7-server-extra-rpms


yum versionlock clear
Update all installed packages:

yum update -y
Restart the host:

reboot
Install Leapp:

yum install -y leapp leapp-repository leapp-upgrade
Perform the upgrade
Run as root:

The Leapp upgrade command:

leapp upgrade --target <target_os_version>
For available <target_os_version> values, see Red Hat: Upgrading from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8: Supported upgrade paths

Once complete, reboot the system. Run as root:

reboot

Run the pre-upgrade report:
sudo leapp preupgrade

Start the upgrade process:
sudo leapp upgrade

2. Monitor the upgrade: The upgrade process may take some time, depending on your system and network speed. Monitor the process for any prompts or errors.
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.json
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log

3. Reboot after the upgrade:

Once the upgrade process completes, reboot your system:
sudo reboot

. Verify the upgrade:

After the system restarts, confirm that the upgrade to RHEL 8 was successful:
cat /etc/redhat-release
